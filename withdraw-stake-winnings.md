# Withdraw Stake Winnings

**How are the winnings from the Woonkly Stake withdrawn?**

You can withdraw your winnings by hitting collect and signing with your Metamask. Winnings are withdrawn in WOOP BEP20 and BNB BEP20. Progressively more tokens will be added to the Woonkly Swap and the Decentralized Social Network, so that in the future the user will earn more tokens from the BEP20 Network.

If the user prefers, instead of withdrawing his earnings, he can press the "Compound" button, only with WOOP tokens. This function will send said tokens to your Stake, generating more automatic returns.

As a last option, the user can press the "Auto compound" button, which will immediately send the WOOP winnings received to his Stake, thus increasing the profits automatically.

{% hint style="info" %}
When withdrawing the earnings in Tokens from the Stake, giving Compound or activating the Auto compound for the first time, it will be necessary to pay gas to sign the transaction. The gas will always be borne by the user who must have BNB BEP20 in his wallet in order to carry out the transaction. Otherwise the system will show an error.
