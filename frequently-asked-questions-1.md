## **Why is it necessary to pass a KYC?**

  
****The KYC is a process that can be somewhat tedious, but necessary and required today by the authorities to avoid money laundering, or the financing of criminal activities. The KYC or "Know Your Customer" is a process of verification of the identity of the user, for which you will need a photograph in which your face is clearly seen next to an identity document or passport, and a report or invoice that proves your address \(you can see valid KYC documents in the next question\)

Woonkly wants to comply with all the regulations established by the organizations and that is why, within its products and / or services, it requires the KYC to be able to use them

### **How can I be a NODE?**

At the moment we do not have any open list to sign up to be a node, when it is necessary for users to become nodes, we will make an official notice in our RRSS and a specific seminar to indicate how to proceed to be a node.

### **VALID DOCUMENTS FOR KYC \(APP.WOONKLY\):**

## **ADD BSC NETWORK AND TOKEN WOOP**

I am sending you a video made by a member of the community that explains step by step how to add the BSC network and the Woop token to Metamask: https://youtu.be/15jp4\_D-M8s

The data you need are the following:

-Binance Smart Chain network data  
****-Network name: Binance Smart Chain  
-New RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/  
-String ID: 56  
-Symbol: BNB  
-Block Explorer URL: https://bscscan.com

Woop token contract data

-CONTRACT: 0x8b303d5bbfbbf46f1a4d9741e491e06986894e18  
-SYMBOL: WOOP  
-DECIMALS: 18

## **Why do my earnings disappear when I put more token in defi.finance?**

When the amount of woops in stake increases, it is automatically harvested and your wDEFI earnings go directly to the wallet from which I stake.

Check that you added the wDEFI contract correctly.

## **What happens if I make a mistake and send tokens to the wrong address?**

You should always check several times that everything is being done correctly. If you send WOOPS or any token to a contract address or to another address, they cannot be recovered and the company holds us responsible for their loss.

Before accepting a shipment, double check everything is correct.  
****

## **Where can I buy WOOP?**

WOOP is for sale on various exchanges and swaps. We have tutorials on our YouTube channel that show you how to acquire them in different ways.  


### Where can I see the price of WOOP?

You can check the price of WOOP at any time on defi.finance, coinmarketcap, swaps where WOOP is available and exchanges that have WOOP listed.

### How do I add wDEFI to my metamask?

You must hit add token! on the BSC network and paste the following contract: 0x291083c8aedfc3cd0384494e1fcdcf2067d28d3e
