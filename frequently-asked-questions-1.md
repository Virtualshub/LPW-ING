## **Why is it necessary to pass a KYC?**

  
****The KYC is a process that can be somewhat tedious, but necessary and required today by the authorities to avoid money laundering, or the financing of criminal activities. 

The KYC or "Know Your Customer" is a process of verification of the identity of the user. To pass the identity verification process, you will need your ID card or passport, a device with a camera for the facial recognition process, and an official document or utility bill that proves your address \(you can see valid KYC documents in the next question\)

Woonkly wants to comply with all the regulations established by the organizations and that is why, within its products and / or services, it requires the KYC to be able to use them

## **How can I be a NODE?**

At the moment, we do not have any available list to sign up to be a node. When this changes, and it is necessary for users to become nodes, we will announce our social media channels and a specific seminar on becoming a Woonkly node.

## **What are the valid documents for KYC? \(Valid for all Woonkly Products\)**

**Identification:**

-ID card or passport  
-For the UK, Canada, and the US the driver's license will be valid \(For the rest of the countries, it's not\)

## **How to add the BSC network and the WOOP?**

You can follow this tutorial on how to add the BSC network and the WOOP token to Metamask: https://youtu.be/15jp4\_D-M8s

The data you need are the following:

-Binance Smart Chain network data  
****-Network name: Binance Smart Chain  
-New RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/  
-String ID: 56  
-Symbol: BNB  
-Block Explorer URL: https://bscscan.com

WOOP token contract data

-CONTRACT: 0x8b303d5bbfbbf46f1a4d9741e491e06986894e18  
-SYMBOL: WOOP  
-DECIMALS: 18

## **Why do my earnings disappear when I put more tokens in defi.finance?**

When the amount of WOOP in stake increases, it is automatically harvested and your wDEFI earnings go directly to the wallet from which you stake.

Remember to check that you added the wDEFI contract correctly.

## **What happens if I make a mistake and send tokens to the wrong address?**

You should always check several times that everything is being done correctly. If you send WOOP or any token to a contract address or to another address, they cannot be recovered and the company is not responsible for their loss.

Before accepting a shipment, double check everything is correct.

## **Where can I buy WOOP?**

WOOP is for sale on various exchanges and swaps. We have tutorials on our YouTube channel that show you how to acquire them in different ways.

## Where can I see the price of WOOP?

You can check the price of WOOP at any time on defi.finance, coinmarketcap, swaps where WOOP is available and exchanges that have WOOP listed.

## How do I add wDEFI to my Metamask?

You must hit add token! on the BSC network and paste the following contract: 0x291083c8aedfc3cd0384494e1fcdcf2067d28d3e
