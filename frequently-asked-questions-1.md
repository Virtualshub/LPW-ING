## **How to add the BSC network and the WOOP?**

You can follow this tutorial on how to add the BSC network and the WOOP token to Metamask: [https://youtu.be/y-1YXDLyxLI](https://youtu.be/y-1YXDLyxLI)

The data you need are the following:

Binance Smart Chain network data:  
****-Network name: Binance Smart Chain  
-New RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/  
-String ID: 56  
-Symbol: BNB  
-Block Explorer URL: https://bscscan.com

WOOP token contract data:

-SYMBOL: WOOP  
-DECIMALS: 18

## **Why do my earnings disappear when I put more tokens in defi.finance?**

When the amount of WOOP in stake increases, it is automatically harvested and your wDEFI earnings go directly to the wallet from which you stake.

Remember to check that you added the wDEFI contract correctly.

## **What happens if I make a mistake and send tokens to the wrong address?**

You should always check several times that everything is being done correctly. If you send WOOP or any token to a contract address or to another address, they cannot be recovered and the company is not responsible for their loss.

Before accepting a shipment, double check everything is correct.

## **Where can I buy WOOP?**

WOOP is for sale on various exchanges and swaps. We have tutorials on our YouTube channel that show you how to acquire them in different ways.

## Where can I see the price of WOOP?

You can check the price of WOOP at any time on defi.finance, coinmarketcap, swaps where WOOP is available and exchanges that have WOOP listed.

## How do I add wDEFI to my Metamask?

You must hit add token! on the BSC network and paste the following contract: 0x291083c8aedfc3cd0384494e1fcdcf2067d28d3e
