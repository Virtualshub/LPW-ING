**How does Woonkly work?**   
  
Creating a campaign in Woonkly is very simple. Advertisers access the Feed Section, choose the way they want to run the campaign, be it text, image, or video, define the audience they want to target their content to through different filters, and create the campaign using crypto.

The user sees these publications and by sharing them on their own network obtains direct benefits in the currency through which the advertiser has advertised.  
  
**How will I earn rewards on Woonkly?** 

There are 3 ways to generate income on Woonkly.  
  
The first, as we mentioned earlier, is to view and share advertisers' content on your own network.

We can also earn cryptocurrencies by interacting with the activities awarded by the creators of the campaigns, activities such as sharing content, subscribing to channels or platforms, or clicking on links.  
  
Finally and the most interesting way to generate money in Woonkly, is through the Stake, generating 100% passive income that comes from a percentage of the campaigns, withdrawals of cryptocurrencies from the platform, and swaps between different tokens. The stake basically consists of connecting your wallet with Woonkly and your WOOP remain without moving it.  
  
**When can I stake Woonkly?** 

Before doing Stake in Woonkly, the system to be audited will have been sent, news will be given of when the stake can be made \(It may take between 1 and 6 months to audit the system\) Any news will be reported in this section and the official networks of woonkly.  
  
**What do I need to be an advertiser?** 

Anyone can be an advertiser on Woonkly, creating a campaign is very simple. The only thing you will need is the content you want to share \(in the case of audiovisual, it is recommended that the duration be 30 seconds\), create an account on the platform, have the token with which you want to create the campaign, and configure it to your liking defining the audience you want it to be addressed to.

If you want to advertise on Woonkly and this cryptocurrency still sounds like Chinese to you, don't worry, because we have created some step-by-step tutorials to make your transition to the crypto world of marketing as simple and intuitive as possible. And you can always count on our support for any questions that may arise during the process.  
  
**Can I be an advertiser and a spectator?** 

Of course! In Woonkly you can both create campaigns and view content with a single account. You can also create an account as a company and manage up to several brands with the same account.  
  
**Why is it necessary to pass a KYC?**   
  
The KYC is a process that can be somewhat tedious, but necessary and required today by the authorities to avoid money laundering, or the financing of criminal activities. The KYC or "Know Your Customer" is a process of verification of the identity of the user, for which you will need a photograph where your face is clearly shown next to an identity document or passport, and a report or invoice that proves your address \(You can see the valid KYC documents in the next question\)  
  
**What are the valid documents for the KYC?** 

**Mandatory requirements:**

-It must be in your name

-Must have an antiquity date of no more than 6 months

-It must contain the address  
  
**Valid documents:**

-Bank statement \(You can cross out data that you do not want to show\)

-Invoices in your name \(Official or direct debit invoices, payments or repairs are not valid, such as a purchase or the repair of a car\)

-Lease contract \(If you are not from the European Union, it must be signed under a notary\)

-Official state documents \(Social Security, payment of taxes, registration, etc.\)  
  
**Where can I buy WOOPS?**

At the moment, the WOOPS purchase system is available through pancakeswap.io and at 1inche.exchange \([https://1inch.exchange/\#/BNB/WOOP](https://1inch.exchange/#/BNB/WOOP)\) the purchase of WOOPS is done through a swap. Soon we will activate the option to acquire WOOPS in swap from our own platform, when this is possible, we will upload tutorials both in this whitepaper and in our RRSS, etc.  
  
**What is PancakeSwap?** 

Currently, Woonkly is exclusively listed on PancakeSwap, which is a decentralized exchange on the BSC \(Binance Smart Chain\) network where you can exchange tokens, add liquidity to the pools through LP tokens thus generating rewards, or stake with its Cake coin to win. Cakes or other BEP20 tokens.  
  
PancakeSwap uses the AMM \(Automated Market maker\) model, so it does not use an Order Book and instead trading is done on the Liquidity Pool.  
  
You can see more information about PancakeSwap, its policies and use on its official website [https://pancakeswap.finance/](https://pancakeswap.finance/)  
  
**What is 1inch.exchange?**  
  
1inch is a DeFi aggregator with a decentralized exchange with smart routing. The core protocol connects a large number of decentralized and centralized platforms to minimize price slippage and find the optimal trade for users. The 1inch platform provides a variety of functions in addition to exchanges. Users can trade through limit orders, deposit funds in loan protocols, move currencies between different liquidity pools, and this list is constantly expanding.  
  
That is, 1inch is a "tracker" that finds where to buy the WOOP and allows you to buy directly from its platform.  
  
**How do I buy WOOP?**   
  
Here we leave you the complete guide to make a purchase of WOOP in [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/).
