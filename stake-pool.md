# Stake Pool

Holders of the Woonkly "WOOP" BEP20 token can voluntarily lock their tokens in the Woonkly Stake Panel, in exchange for obtaining a percentage of the net profit from the Woonkly protocol.  
  
**100% of Woonkly's Net Profit is tokenized and decentralized.**  
  
Within the Woonkly Stake Panel you can block your tokens to obtain liquidity at any time from 100 WOOP, being able to add individual units from that minimum amount \(example: 100 + 1\).  
  
****Every 100 WOOP represents 0.00001% of the net profit of the Woonkly protocol, with 100,000 WOOP being 0.01% and 1,000,000,000 WOOP \(the max supply\) 100% of the net profit.
