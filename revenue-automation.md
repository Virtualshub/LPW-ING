# Revenue Automation

Everything that is done on Woonkly is done on the Blockchain. Therefore, the entire token flow is 100% automated.  
  
**Profit automation percentages**

**DECENTRALIZED SOCIAL NETWORK: When an advertiser creates a decentralized campaign:**

* 80% tokens invested by advertisers in advertising are distributed among their target audience for interacting with their content and sharing it.
* 15% tokens are distributed in the Stake Pool.
* 2.5% tokens go to the direct or commercial affiliate who introduced the advertiser.
* 2.5% tokens are distributed in the Woonkly Operation Pool.

**INTERNAL DEX AMM: When users buy or sell WOOP and BNB:**  


* 0.2% of the profits of the Swap between tokens is distributed among the liquidity providers \(farming\).
* 0.1% is distributed in the Stake Pool.
* 0.05% is distributed in the Woonkly Trading Pool.

**EXTERNAL AMM DEX: When users buy or sell any token from the ERC20 or BEP20 Networks in the external DEX created by Woonkly:**  


* 0.2% of the profits of the Swap between tokens is distributed among the liquidity providers \(farming\).
* 0.05% is distributed in the Woonkly Stake Pool.
* 0.05% is distributed in the Woonkly Operation Pool.

**WOONKLY ACCELERATOR OF STARTUPS BASED ON BLOCKCHAIN: When Woonkly accelerates and invests in a Startup, the benefit of the tokens that it receives in return is sent directly to the Woonkly Stake POOL.**  


* 80% of the profits obtained through the capital invested by Woonkly in accelerating projects goes directly to the Woonkly Stake Pool to be distributed among the WOOP BEP20 Token holders, who are locked in the Stake Smart Contract.

> "In every project created or accelerated by Woonkly there will always be a direct benefit for Woonkly stakers."
