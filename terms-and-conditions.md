**YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT GETTING ANY WOOP TOKEN FROM THE COMPANY, EXCHANGE, SWAP, STAKE, POOL, SALE OF WOOP, ETC, AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE COMPANY'S PLATFORM ENTAILS SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL, REGULATORY, AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS, OF THESE T&C.**

**BY MAKING ANY PURCHASE, EXCHANGE, SWAP, OR ANY ACTION THAT IS INTENDED TO GET WOOP AND ACCEPTING THESE T&C, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE RISKS SET IN THESE T&C AND THE WEBPAGE OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT CONSIDERED FOR WOONKLY.**

**13.1**   Risk of Software Weaknesses: Because WOOP, the Smart Contract System and the company's platform are based on the Binance Smart Chain protocol, any malfunction, failure or abandonment of the Binance Smart Chain protocol can have a significant adverse effect on WOOP, the Smart Contract System and/or the company's Platform.

**13.2**   Regulatory risk: Blockchain technology \('public platform'\) enables new forms of interaction and certain jurisdictions may enforce existing regulations or introduce new regulations that address applications based on public platform technology, which may be contrary to the current configuration of Smart Contract System and/or the Company's website application portfolio / server and which may, among other things, result in substantial modifications to the Company's Smart Contract System and/or Platform, including its termination and loss of WOOP for the user/holder.

**13.3**   Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions: The regulatory status of Woonkly OÜ and distributed ledger technology and the Company's website application portfolio/server or the Company's Platform is unclear or unresolved in many jurisdictions. It is difficult or impossible to predict how or if regulatory authorities can enforce existing regulation regarding such technology and its applications, including the Company Platform and the WOOP. Additionally, it is difficult to predict how or if legislative or regulatory authorities may implement changes to law and regulation that affect distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Company Platform and the WOOP. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Company Platform and the WOOP in several ways, including, for illustrative purposes only, through the determination that Woonkly OÜ and the WOOP requires new registration or licenses. The company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to the law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in that jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to operate in that jurisdiction.

**13.4**               Risk of abandonment/lack of success: the creation and issuance of the WOOP and the development of the Company Platform may in the future be abandoned or cease to exist for various reasons, including lack of public interest, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects \(for example, caused by competing projects\). There is no guarantee that even if the Company's Platform is developed and partially or fully launched, you will receive the benefits through the WOOP you own.

**13.5**               Risks Associated with the WOOP Markets: We cannot enable or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of the WOOP. This may restrict the envisioned avenues for using the WOOP and therefore could create a risk of illiquidity with respect to any WOOP you own. Although potentially in the future secondary trading in the WOOP will be facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.

**13.6**               Risk of losing access to tokens due to loss of private key \(s\), custody error or your mistake: WOOP can only be accessed using an Binance Smart Chain BEP20 wallet provided by the Company with a combination of the purchaser account information \(address\), private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. You acknowledge, understand, and agree that if your private key or password is lost or stolen, the obtained WOOP associated with your Binance Smart Chain Wallet address may be unrecoverable and permanently lost. Furthermore, any third party that gains access to your private key, including by gaining access to the login credentials related to your Binance Smart Chain wallet provided by the Company, can misappropriate your WOOP.

**13.7**               Risk of theft: The Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and the software platform \(i.e. the Binance Smart Chain public platform or the Company's website application wallet / server or the Company's Platform\) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or others, including but not limited to malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. Any of these successful attacks could result in the theft or loss of Tokens or WOOP, negatively impacting the ability to develop the Company Platform and derive any use or functionality of Woonkly. Furthermore, because the Company Platform is based on open source software and third-party software.

**13.8**               Risk of mining attacks: As with any token in any wallet \(including the Company's website wallet / application server or Company Platform\), public platforms, the blockchain used for the Smart Contract System it is susceptible to extraction or any other attack, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority extraction attacks, "self-extraction" attacks, and rare-condition attacks. Any successful attack presents a risk to the Smart Contract System, the expected execution and sequencing of token transactions and the expected execution and sequencing of contract calculations.

**13.9**               Incompatible Wallet Service Risk - The Company will be provided thought their own platform wallet or wallet service used to receive the WOOP is intended to comply with the Binance Smart Chain token standard to be technically WOOP compliant. There is a possibility that a software update to the Company's portfolio / server could cause a failure to ensure such compliance and may result in the purchaser not gaining access to their WOOP.

**13.10**            Risk of uninsured losses: Unlike bank accounts or accounts at other financial institutions, Woonkly or the WOOP does not carry insurance unless you obtain private insurance specifically to insure them yourself. Therefore, in the event of loss or loss of value of utilities, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us to offer you a remedy.

**13.11**            Tax risks: the tax characterization of the WOOP is uncertain. You should seek your own tax advice in relation to the acquisition, storage, transfer and use of WOOP, which may have adverse tax consequences for you, including but not limited to withholding tax, transfer tax, value added tax, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, fees or other charges and tax reporting requirements in any applicable jurisdiction.

**13.12**            Risk of dissolution of the Company or the network: It is possible that due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of BNB \(or other crypto and fiat currencies\), the usefulness of the WOOP may decrease due to negative adoption of the Company's Platform, failure of business relationships, or intellectual property challenges, or lack of funding or any other reason that causes the Company or the company in question in clauses of these T&C are not viable as a business or do a voluntary/involuntary liquidation or enter into bankruptcy or bankruptcy protection, or simply the Company may no longer be viable to operate and the company's platform may be dissolved.

**13.13**            Risks arising from lack of governance rights: because the WOOP does not confer governance rights of any kind with respect to the Company or the Company Platform, all decisions involving the Company Platform or the Company will be taken acting at its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to: decisions to discontinue the Company's Platform, or sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could negatively affect the Company Platform and / or WOOP owners.

**13.14**            Competing Platforms Risk: Alternative platforms may be established that use the same open source code and / or third party software \(i.e. wallet / server\) used by the Company and / or protocol underlying the Company Platform and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to services offered by or within the Company Platform. The Company Platform may compete with these alternatives, which could adversely affect the Company Platform and SCRHT, including the usefulness of WOOP to obtain services offered by or within the Company Platform.

**13.15**            Unforeseen risks: Cryptographic tokens like the WOOP are a new technology and not yet proven or not yet sufficiently proven. In addition to the risks set forth in these clauses, there are other risks associated with your acquisition, storage, transfer, and use of the WOOP, including those that the Company cannot anticipate or lose. Such risks can materialize further as unforeseen variations or comb.

**14.**  **SECURITY**

**14.1** You are responsible for implementing all reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the Wallet, safe or other storage mechanism that you use to interact with the services of the Company and to receive and store WOOP issued to you by the Smart Contract System, including keys Required private \(s\), passwords, two or three factor authentication, or other credentials required to access such storage mechanisms. If your private keys or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to your WOOP. The company will not be responsible for any security measures related to its receipt, possession, storage.

**15.**  **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**
