# Add liquidity to the POOL

At Woonkly.com, any user can add liquidity to the decentralized POOL. Liquidity can be added in the BNB / WOOP pair or even just in BNB through our innovative "shared liquidity" protocol.  
  
This liquidity is housed in a Tri-audited Smart Contract and allows the market to grow in a proportional and stable way with the price. The more liquidity users add to the liquidity POOL in the Smart Contract, the more daily volume there will be, the market will be healthier and will allow anyone to enter or exit it immediately with larger and larger amounts without drastically affecting the price.  
  
When users use the Woonkly Swap to exchange tokens, a commission is charged. This commission is shared with the liquidity providers, which makes it very attractive for users to add liquidity to the POOL since they begin to earn tokens from each swap automatically.

**Impermanent loss or non-permanent loss**

Non-permanent loss, also called divergent loss, is the difference between when you have tokens in an AMM \(Automated Market Maker\) liquidity pool and simply hold \(Hold\) them on the blockchain. When tokens are provided for liquidity in the market, they are funded to other users from a liquidity pool. When held, the tokens are simply held at market value.  
  
By providing liquidity, the price of tokens in a liquidity pool can diverge in either direction. The more divergence there is, the more temporary loss the user \(that is, the liquidity provider\) suffers. This is called "non-permanent" because it can only be temporary. When the price of the tokens returns to the original value that the user had invested, the loss is erased. This is a common occurrence in liquidity funds, but it can turn into a permanent loss if the user withdraws their liquidity and absorbs the losses or if the price continues to diverge and the user loses more tokens as a result.  
  
Due to market volatility, losses can become permanent in the short term. This severely affects a user's investment in a group when it generates negative returns. This occurs due to how the AMM quotes the value of the tokens. If the AMM is not directly connected to external markets, when the price changes in other exchanges, it does not automatically adjust its price.
