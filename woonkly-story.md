# Woonkly Story

**Woonkly was born from the idea of ​​sharing the advertising capital directly with the audience that consumes the ads, eliminating the intermediaries \(the media\) who normally make 100% of the profit.**

The idea was born in 2014 and was consolidated in January 2018 when it won the acceleration award of the "Plug & Play" accelerator in Mexico.

From the acceleration, Woonkly was integrated with the world of Blockchain.

The idea was tested in several of the largest cryptocurrency events in the world, during 2018 and 2019. In these meetings, the first prototype was shown to experts in the sector, who validated its concept.

These events include:

* TNW Amsterdam, May 2018
* The Berlin Blockshow created by Cointelegraph, June 2018
* The Bitcoinference in Brussels, June 2018
* The Blockchain Economic Forum in San Francisco, July 2018
* Bitcoin Day in Monterrey, August 2018
* International Cryptocurrency Investment Congress in Dubai, September 2018
* Blockchain Murcia, May 2019

After proving that the concept had a place within the crypto and advertising world, Woonkly started operations with a team of developers in Mexico.  


Today, Woonkly has more than 17 developers and a team of professionals located in different parts of the world. In addition, Woonkly found a great market opportunity, since there are many areas in which innovation is required and various needs to be covered because the blockchain and crypto world is an ecosystem in constant evolution.  


Therefore, Woonkly became a corporate technology solutions "Woonkly Labs" and the initial social network application one of its branches.
