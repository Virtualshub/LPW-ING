# Gains from adding Liquidity

When a user adds liquidity to the Woonkly Pool he begins to earn tokens automatically. Initially they will earn BNB and WOOP, then they will be able to earn any pair of tokens that have been added to the Liquidity Pool.  
  
The gains from adding liquidity can be seen in the "Stake Panel" tab. These earnings are reflected as "Farm Earnings". No need to do anything after adding liquidity, the user will immediately see its earnings reflected each time a user performs a "Swap" between tokens.  
  
To withdraw the profits, the user will only have to click the "collect" or "collect" button, sign with their Metamask \(and on Trust Wallet mobile phones\) and immediately the Smart Contract will transfer their earned tokens to their external wallet.

{% hint style="info" %}
The user will always pay the gas of the transaction in the Binance Smart Chain network, so it is recommended to withdraw profits when they are higher than the gas commission that will be charged. This gas commission is paid in BNB BEP20 \(BNB of the Binance Smart Chain network\) so the user must have BNB BEP20 in the wallet in which they will receive the funds or else the transaction will fail.
