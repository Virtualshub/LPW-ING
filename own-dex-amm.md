# Own DEX \(AMM\)

Woonkly has created a decentralized Exchange with its own AMM \(Automated Market Maker\) protocol, developed 100% on Blockchain with Smart Contracts compatible with ERC20 and BEP20.  
  
This protocol is the skeleton or "core" of three of Woonkly's Products.

* The buy-sell swap of the "WOOP" platform token, created on Binance Smart Chain.
* The DEX Multitoken / Multichain ERC20 / BEP20 that allows exchange tokens and creates liquidity pools within the Ethereum network and within the Binance Smart Chain network.
* The DEX Crosschain Bridge between ERC20 and BEP20 Networks that allows to exchange tokens between different blockchains immediately.
