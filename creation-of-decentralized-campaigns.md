# Creation of decentralized campaigns

Creating campaigns in Woonkly is very simple. As an advertiser, you just have to follow these steps:  
  
1. Create a POST. It can contain text, image, video or audio.

2. Connect your  Metamask or Trust Wallet.

3. Choose with which Token \(BNB or WOOP\) you are going to run your campaign and how many times you want them to see and share your content \(there is a minimum number of shares and from there it is modifiable\). _The more tokens an advertiser hands out, the higher it appears in their target audience's social media feed._

5. Done! Your post will be published decentralized and your campaign will be active! Now it will only remain to be seen by the analytics in your analysis panel.
