# Blockchain-based Startup Accelerator

Woonkly OU is a company created by serial entrepreneurs and that is why we have a real commitment to innovation and the young talents that they develop on Blockchain.  
  
The Woonkly accelerator currently has a Capital of 2,000 BNBs and acquires a direct 10% of all the capital that Woonkly obtains for the operation through its protocols. This capital allows incubation, acceleration, mentoring and investment in blockchain-based projects with the most Spanish-speaking potential.  
  
Countries where the Woonkly accelerator will have a presence:

* Estonia: Official Headquarters of Woonkly OU.
* Spain: Association with Cryptoplaza \(Madrid\), where Startups associated with Cryptoplaza are accelerated.
* Mexico: Directed by the Plug & Play Mexico Investor.

Woonkly's goal is to accelerate at least five Projects per year, based on Blockchain.  
  
****80% of the Profit reported by the accelerated Startups with Woonkly capital is distributed among the holders of Woonkly "WOOP" tokens, as long as they are locked in the Stake protocol.  
  
**THE FIRST CALL FOR STARTUPS OF THE WOONKLY ACCELERATOR WILL BE IN APRIL 2021. WE WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION HERE REGARDING THE PROCEDURE TO PARTICIPATE.**
