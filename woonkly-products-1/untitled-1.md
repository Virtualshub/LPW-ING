# Decentralized Social Network \(In Process\)

Massive Social Networks today have full control over user data, which they use for their own purposes without the explicit consent of the consumer.

> **"Woonkly gives the power of data back to users."**

  
All Woonkly Social Network technology is being developed on its own Blockchain, created in Hyperledger BESU and with direct connection to Polkadot, Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

* Advertisers can viralize their content using cryptocurrencies.
* 80% of the Capital invested by advertisers in viralizing their "posts" is distributed among the audience that sees said content simply by sharing it.
