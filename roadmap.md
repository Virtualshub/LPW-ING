# Roadmap

**The world continues to change at a dizzying rate, therefore making a road map for several years today is an unfair and completely uncertain practice. That is why at Woonkly we stick with clear and concise goals, always looking a year ahead and projecting each year's goals as the previous year ends. Woonkly is alive, evolving and adapting to the world, and that is why our Road Map does too.
