# Tokenomics Woop

There are 1,000,000,000 \(one billion\) of WOOP, our Utility Token created on the Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\) network. Currently, there are more than 8,900 Holders and more than 288,000 Transactions on the Blockchain as of August 18, 2021. [See here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x8b303d5bbfbbf46f1a4d9741e491e06986894e18).  
  
The 1,000,000,000 \( one billion\) of WOOPs are pre-mined and no more can be created, which means that the number of WOOPs in circulation is finite and non-inflationary.  
  
**TOKENS STRUCTURE:**

* 43,5.% are currently owned by the Community.
  * Approximate 10,30% is reserved for the Swap Woonk-WOOP in [THIS WALLET](https://bscscan.com/address/0xE7F0c9ac0869B42d37A0a73bD477068e317f42E3) and [THIS WALLET](https://bscscan.com/address/0xb6cc7004ffff12bb8d6599aca140799e0f55a6c2). \(These wallets will decrease when users who have Woonks \(Woonkly's old ERC20 token\) transform them to WOOP \(The only token currently operating in Woonkly, created on the Binance Smart Chain network\).
  * Approximate 33.2% is already in the Wallets of users who have already invested in Woonkly.
* 40% Team and advisors \(14-year gradual lockdown\). [See HERE](https://bscscan.com/address/0xcd10B782bb32Cb673b7Fe2E8C9Ec9AeD8f14e8ad).
* 15% Woonkly Reserve that will be used to provide liquidity to the DEX. [See here](https://bscscan.com/address/0xba16ae114d1914d1774715a3a553868551250a99).
* 1% Liquidity blocked in the Wault Finance protocol
* 0.5% Liquidity in Pancakeswap.finance

40% of the WOOP Tokens are in the hands of the team and advisors, but to protect the market, a blockade of the Tokens has been imposed for 14 years with a progressive release. The blockade will begin on April 1, 2021, leaving only 1% of the tokens released in the first year at the beginning. You can see the Smart Contract of the Block of Tokens of the team and advisors [HERE](https://github.com/Woonkly/STAKESmartContractPreRelease/blob/main/Investing.sol). The team and advisors cannot sell the blocked WOOPs, only the unlocked ones, but they can Stake in Woonkly and receive the corresponding benefits in tokens.

**Unlocking structure of Team Tokens and Advisors:**

* Year 0: Released 1%
* Year 1: Release of 1%
* Year 2: Release of 2%
* Year 3: Release of 3%
* And so on, adding a release of an extra 1% per year.
* Year 14: Total release of the remaining tokens.

The blocking of team and advisors tokens helps protect the large capital sales market and gives priority to new token holders. This allows creating a stable and sustainable market over time.

Currently, 40% of the tokens are blocked from April 1, 2021 in a Smart Contract; 15% belongs to the Woonkly Reserve to add liquidity in the Shared Liquidity Pool; and the approximate 10,3% has not yet been exchanged from Woonks \(old Woonkly token\) to WOOP \(new Woonkly token\); which means that **APPROXIMATELY ONLY 33,7% OF TOKENS ARE REALLY IN CIRCULATION TODAY \(About 337,000,000 WOOP\).**  


_100% of the 1,000,000,000 \(one billion\) of WOOP will not be in circulation until April 1, 2035._
